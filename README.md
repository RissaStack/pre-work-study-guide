# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was to create a place to have all the information I learned in my prework.
- I built this project in order to keep track of all my information from my prework on Git, HTML, CSS, and JS.
- It solves the problem of where all the information for each subject goes. It will organize all of my prework information to study.
- I learned how to organize the foundation of a webpage using HTML, how to change colors on the webpage using CSS, and I am honestly still very confused about Git and JS. I need some more help looking at that information.
